# Web-Based HL7 Message Analysis & Management Platform

## 1. Project Overview & Purpose

This project develops a modern, web-based application for viewing, editing, and managing Health Level Seven (HL7) messages. It addresses the need for a more accessible, collaborative, and platform-independent alternative to traditional desktop-based HL7 tools. By leveraging a modern web stack, the platform will provide healthcare IT professionals, developers, and analysts with a fast, intuitive, and feature-rich environment for HL7 data interaction. The desired end state is a deployed web application that serves as a centralized hub for HL7 message parsing, validation, anonymization, and analysis.

## 2. Key Objectives

- **Develop Core Viewing & Editing Capabilities**: Implement a user-friendly interface to parse, translate, and display HL7 messages in a human-readable format, with capabilities for direct in-line editing and validation.

- **Establish Robust Message Management**: Create a secure and searchable repository for storing, retrieving, and comparing HL7 messages, backed by a flexible database.

- **Provide Actionable Data Insights**: Build a dashboard to generate and visualize statistics from stored messages, offering insights into message volume, types, and trends.

- **Enable Basic System Integration**: Deliver a foundational RESTful API to allow for programmatic interaction, enabling integration with other modern web services.

## 3. Scope of Work

### In-Scope:

#### Message Viewing & Interpretation:
- Parsing and translation of raw HL7 messages into a human-readable, structured format
- Interactive highlighting that links translated fields to their corresponding raw message segments
- A grid-based view for displaying message segments and fields
- Syntax and color-coding for raw HL7 message text to improve readability

#### Message Editing & Validation:
- Direct editing of message data within the UI
- Integration of HL7 lookup tables for field-level assistance (e.g., dropdowns for standard codes)
- Backend validation of messages against the HL7 standard
- A feature to anonymize messages by removing Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

#### Message Management & Analysis:
- Secure storage of HL7 messages (raw and parsed) in a central database
- A "diff" tool to compare two messages and highlight differences
- Advanced search functionality to query messages based on specific field values
- A statistics dashboard with visualizations (e.g., charts) for message analytics

#### API & Accessibility:
- A RESTful API for programmatic access (e.g., uploading, retrieving messages) using API key authentication
- In-browser clipboard support for easy pasting of HL7 data
- A pre-loaded library of sample HL7 messages for demonstration and training

## 4. Target Audience / End-Users

- **Primary Audience**: Healthcare Integration Analysts & Developers who need to troubleshoot, validate, and test HL7 interfaces
- **Secondary Audience**: Hospital IT Staff & System Administrators who manage health information systems and need to inspect message logs or data quality
- **Tertiary Audience**: Quality Assurance (QA) Engineers who test applications that produce or consume HL7 data

## 5. Key Deliverables

- A deployed, production-ready Next.js web application with all in-scope features
- A documented RESTful API that allows authenticated users to interact with the system programmatically
- A database schema for storing users, messages, configurations, and HL7 lookup tables
- User-facing documentation or tooltips explaining how to use the core features of the application
- A curated set of sample HL7 messages integrated into the application

## 6. High-Level Requirements

### Functional Requirements:
- The system must allow users to create an account and log in
- The system must allow users to paste or upload raw HL7 files
- The system shall parse any valid HL7 v2.x message into a structured JSON format
- The system must render the parsed message in both a raw text view and a structured grid view
- Users must be able to edit fields in the grid view and save the changes as a new version or overwrite the existing message
- The system must provide a function to create an anonymized copy of a message
- The system must allow searching of the message repository by criteria such as Patient Name, Message Type (e.g., ADT^A04), or other specific identifiers

### Non-Functional Requirements:
- **Performance**: Message parsing and rendering should complete within 2 seconds for typical message sizes (<10KB). Search queries should return results in under 3 seconds
- **Scalability**: The architecture must support at least 100 concurrent users and a database of over 1 million HL7 messages without significant performance degradation
- **Reliability**: The application shall have an uptime of 99.9%. All data storage operations must be atomic and handle failures gracefully
- **Usability**: The user interface must be intuitive, requiring minimal training for users familiar with HL7 concepts

### User & UI/UX Requirements:
- The UI must be responsive and fully functional on modern desktop web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
- Interactive elements (hovers, clicks) must provide immediate visual feedback
- Validation errors and system status (e.g., "Saving...", "Success") must be clearly communicated to the user
- The design shall be clean and professional, prioritizing readability of complex data

### Data Requirements:
- The system must store both the original raw HL7 string and its parsed JSON representation
- The system will store standard HL7 code sets (e.g., gender, message types) in a dedicated collection for use in dropdowns and validation
- All message documents in the database must be associated with the user who uploaded them and include metadata such as creation and modification timestamps

### Security & Compliance:
- User authentication must be secure, with passwords hashed and salted
- All data transmission between the client and server must be encrypted using HTTPS
- Given the potential for Protected Health Information (PHI), the system must be designed with HIPAA compliance in mind (e.g., audit trails for data access, strong access controls), even if formal certification is out of scope
- The anonymization feature must effectively remove all standard PII fields as defined by HIPAA's Safe Harbor method

## 7. Recommended Tech Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js (React) - Chosen for its server-side rendering (SSR) capabilities for fast initial page loads, API routes for backend logic, and a rich ecosystem of UI components
- **Database**: MongoDB - A NoSQL database ideal for storing schemaless or semi-structured data like parsed HL7 messages (JSON). Its powerful querying and aggregation framework are well-suited for the search and statistics features
- **HL7 Parsing Library**: A Node.js compatible library (e.g., node-hl7-parser) to handle the backend parsing logic within the Next.js API routes
- **UI Component Library**: A library like Material-UI (MUI) or Tailwind CSS to ensure a consistent and professional look-and-feel
- **Data Visualization**: A charting library like Chart.js or D3.js for rendering the statistics dashboard

## 8. Known Constraints & Assumptions

### Assumptions:
- This document outlines a new web application and does not involve migrating data from an existing HL7 Soup desktop application
- The primary target users have a working knowledge of the HL7 standard
- The project budget and timeline will accommodate the development of the features defined in the 'In-Scope' section

### Constraints:
- The application will be web-based only and will not have a corresponding desktop version
- The application must be built using the specified Next.js and MongoDB stack
