# **Project Requirements and Guidelines: Advanced HL7 Viewer and Editor**

---

## 1. Project Overview & Purpose

This project will create a web-based, advanced **HL7 Viewer and Editor**. The primary goal is to provide healthcare IT professionals, interface analysts, and developers with a powerful tool to view, edit, validate, and transform HL7 v2.x messages. The application will simplify the process of working with complex HL7 data by offering an intuitive user interface that highlights message segments, validates against standard and custom schemas (such as the UK's ITK for NHS), and allows for seamless data manipulation and conversion. The desired end state is a robust, user-friendly platform that enhances productivity and accuracy when managing HL7 message workflows.

## 2. Key Objectives

* **Develop an intuitive HL7 message viewer and editor** with syntax highlighting and direct content manipulation.
* **Implement a comprehensive validation engine** that supports standard HL7 schemas and allows for the import of custom schemas (e.g., UK ITK).
* **Enable robust message management features**, including creating, saving, copying, and filtering of multiple messages.
* **Provide powerful data transformation capabilities** to convert HL7 messages to and from JSON, XML, and CSV formats.
* **Ensure seamless data persistence** by enabling messages to be written to and read from a MongoDB database.

## 3. Scope of Work

### **In-Scope:**

* **HL7 Message Rendering**: Display HL7 messages in a structured, easy-to-read format with clear segment and field delineation.
* **Hyperlink Highlighting**: Automatically identify and hyperlink key message components for quick navigation and analysis.
* **Message Validation**:
    * Validate messages against a range of HL7 v2.x versions (2.1 through 2.9).
    * Support for importing and validating against custom or third-party HL7 schemas (e.g., UK's ITK for NHS).
* **Message Editing and Management**:
    * Create new HL7 messages from scratch or based on templates.
    * Save and copy existing messages.
    * Edit the contents of any segment or field within a message.
    * Apply edits to multiple selected messages simultaneously.
* **Message Filtering**: Provide a robust filtering mechanism to quickly find messages based on their content or metadata.
* **Table Lookups**:
    * Implement functionality to perform table lookups within a message.
    * Allow users to customize and manage these lookup tables.
* **Custom Rules Engine**:
    * Enable users to create, edit, and export custom highlighting and validation rules.
* **Data Transformation**:
    * Export HL7 messages to JSON, XML, and CSV (Excel) formats.
    * Import data from JSON, XML, and CSV to create or update HL7 messages.
* **Database Integration**:
    * Persist and retrieve HL7 messages from a MongoDB database.
* **Workflow Activities**: Provide capabilities for defining and executing custom workflow activities related to message manipulation.

### **Out-of-Scope:**

* **Real-time Message Transmission**: This tool is for viewing, editing, and analysis, not for real-time sending or receiving of HL7 messages over a network (e.g., via MLLP).
* **HL7 v3 and FHIR Support**: The initial version will exclusively support HL7 v2.x. Support for other standards like HL7 v3 or FHIR is not included.
* **User Authentication and Authorization**: A comprehensive user management system with roles and permissions is not part of this initial scope.
* **Advanced Reporting and Analytics**: While basic filtering is included, detailed analytics and reporting on message data are not.
* **Direct EMR/EHR Integration**: The application will not directly integrate with Electronic Medical Record or Electronic Health Record systems.

## 4. Target Audience / End-Users

* **Primary Audience: Healthcare Interface Analysts and Developers**: These users require a powerful tool to troubleshoot, validate, and manipulate HL7 messages during interface development and maintenance. They need detailed control over message structure and content.
* **Secondary Audience: Healthcare IT Support Staff**: This group needs an easy-to-use tool to view and understand the content of HL7 messages for support and troubleshooting purposes. They will benefit from the clear message rendering and validation features.
* **Tertiary Audience: Quality Assurance and Testing Teams**: These users will leverage the tool to create test data, validate message formats against specific requirements, and ensure the quality of HL7 interfaces.

---

## 5. Key Deliverables

* A fully functional **Next.js web application** for viewing and editing HL7 messages.
* A documented **RESTful API** for message manipulation.
* A **MongoDB schema** for storing HL7 messages and associated user-defined rules.
* A **user guide** detailing the features and functionalities of the application.
* The ability to import **custom HL7 validation schemas**.

---

## 6. High-Level Requirements

### **Functional Requirements:**

* The system must parse and render all specified **HL7 v2.x message versions**.
* The system must allow for the creation of a new HL7 message from a blank slate.
* Users must be able to upload an HL7 file for viewing and editing.
* The system must provide **in-line editing** for all message segments and fields.
* Users must be able to save edited messages to the MongoDB database.
* The system must implement a **search and filter functionality** to query messages based on message type, sending facility, or content within a specific segment.
* The system must provide options to **export a given HL7 message** to JSON, XML, or CSV format.
* The system must allow users to define and import custom validation rule sets.

### **Non-Functional Requirements:**

* **Performance**: The application should load and render large HL7 messages (up to 1MB) within 2-3 seconds. Filtering and search operations on a database of 100,000 messages should complete in under 5 seconds.
* **Scalability**: The application architecture should be able to handle a growing number of users and a large volume of stored HL7 messages without significant degradation in performance.
* **Reliability**: The application should be highly available, with a target uptime of 99.9%. Data persistence and transformation operations must be atomic and error-handled to prevent data corruption.
* **Usability**: The user interface should be intuitive and require minimal training for users familiar with HL7 concepts.

### **User & UI/UX Requirements:**

* The UI must present HL7 messages in a **color-coded, hierarchical, or tabular view** for easy readability.
* Each segment, field, and component of the HL7 message must be clearly delineated.
* Validation errors and warnings must be clearly highlighted in the UI, with descriptive tooltips explaining the issue.
* The application must have a clean, modern, and **responsive design** that works well on standard desktop screen sizes.

### **Data Requirements:**

* The system will store HL7 messages in their raw text format, along with metadata such as creation date, last modified date, and user-defined tags.
* Custom validation rules, highlighting preferences, and table lookups will be stored as structured documents in MongoDB.
* The application must support **UTF-8 character encoding**.

### **Security & Compliance:**

* As the application may handle Protected Health Information (PHI), all data in transit and at rest must be **encrypted**.
* The application should be designed with **HIPAA security principles** in mind, even if formal certification is out of scope for the initial version.
* There should be no hard-coded credentials or sensitive information in the frontend code.

## 7. Recommended Tech Stack ðŸ’»

* **Full-Stack Framework**: **Next.js** - The application will be built as a full-stack monolith using Next.js. This includes using Next.js for the React-based frontend and **Next.js API Routes** for the server-side logic and RESTful API endpoints. This simplifies development and deployment into a single, unified framework.
* **Database**: **MongoDB** - A NoSQL database that offers a flexible schema, making it well-suited for storing HL7 messages and various user-defined configurations.
* **HL7 Parsing Library**: A well-maintained Node.js library for parsing and manipulating HL7 messages (e.g., `node-hl7-parser`) will be integrated into the Next.js backend.
